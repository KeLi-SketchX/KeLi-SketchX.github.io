I am currently Associate Professor at School of Artificial Intelligence in BUPT. I received the PhD at [Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems (PRIS)](http://www.pris.net.cn/) laboratory of BUPT in 2019.During PHD career, I was under the join supervision of [Professor Honggang Zhang](https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/zhanghonggang/zh_CN/index.htm) (the director of PRIS) and [Dr. Yi-Zhe Song](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=irZFP_AAAAAJ&hl=en) (the director of [SketchX](http://sketchx.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/)).

My research interest is Computer Vision and Machine Learning, particularly focus on Sketch, Video analysis, Information Retrieval.
