permalink: /publication/ECCV2018
excerpt: 'In this work we aim to develop a universal sketch grouper. That is, a grouper that can be applied to sketches of any category in any domain to group constituent strokes/segments into semantically meaningful object parts. Meanwhile, we contribute the largest sketch perceptual grouping (SPG) dataset to date, consisting of 20, 000 unique sketches evenly distributed over 25 object categories.'
