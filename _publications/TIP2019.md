"Towards Deep Universal Sketch Perceptual Grouper",TIP2019

'In this work, we make the first attempt to develop a universal sketch perceptual grouper. That is, a grouper that can be applied to sketches of any category created with any drawing style and ability, to group constituent strokes/segments into semantically meaningful object parts.'
